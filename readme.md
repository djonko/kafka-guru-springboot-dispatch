- Learn how to create robust Kafka implementations using Spring Boot 3 and Apache Kafka

--

This is the course for learning Kafka, Java, Spring and Spring Boot!
Our hands-on course is designed to teach you the concepts of Apache Kafka and demonstrates the advantages to be gained by using the Spring framework.
By the end of the course you will have learned and used the techniques required of a production quality system that uses Apache Kafka

Your learning journey will take you cover:

Kafka Fundamentals

Unit Tests and Integration Testing using Embedded brokers

Failure concepts and how to handle them - Retries, Poison Pills, and DLQs

Coding your own event driven services that communicate using Kafka.

And much more!



This course will take you as a developer who knows just the basics on Spring Boot and Java to being able to develop a fully functional, fully tested, application that connects with the Kafka messaging broker in order to send and receive messages.

In fact with our comprehensive code walkthroughs that start from scratch in writing our Spring Boot application you would be able to put together the application with no previous Spring Boot experience!

This course has been developed by a team of highly experienced Java Software Engineers and Kafka consultants working closely with John Thompson, the Spring Framework Guru - we understand what a developer needs from such a course - we have designed and implemented many Kafka systems that are in production today.


Code Samples
All the code that we walk through is available in the included git repositories for you to use as a starting point for your work, or for you to fork and extend as you begin to explore Kafka further.  Along the way there are assignments enabling you to put in practice what you have been learning, to build out a fully rounded microservices architecture.  We have accompanying articles on many of the Kafka concepts covered in the course - these go into greater depth providing you the opportunity to continue your learning and gain an advanced understanding on these areas.
